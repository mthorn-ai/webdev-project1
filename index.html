    <p>Hi! My name is Matthew (or just Matt) and this is my last semester at IIT. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have a lot of programming experience, but I haven't programmed that much in HTML. Although, I did program a good bit in Typescript to develop a user interface for a mobile application, which used some HTML code even though it was mostly for the style sheets. I'll put some GIF files showing that off below. It's not very pretty, but it works kinda sorta. I'm looking into web development as a potential career option and for some reason the CS curriculum doesn't include a class like this. So, I'm excited to develop more projects like this!</p>
